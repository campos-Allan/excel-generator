## Disclaimer
It’s not possible to share the files and info's that this script was using it, and I scrambled the variable names and other stuff to make it anonymous, might made some mistakes in this step.

## Structure
Basic script that picks a spreadsheet model based on the month in question, changes a few cells to update the queries and then saves this spreadsheet with specific name formatting.

## Approach
Useing 'win32com.client' tools and 'datetime'.
